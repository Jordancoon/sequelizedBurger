### 2. Students Do: Handlebars Animals (20 minutes)

* Answer whatever questions your students may have about the application's functions before slacking out the following:

  * **Files**

    * [2-HandlebarsAnimalsBase](Activities/2-HandlebarsAnimalsBase)

  * **Instructions**

    * You will edit the `server.js` file, the `dog.handlebars` file, and the `index.handlebars` file in an attempt to recreate the application that we demonstrated just a couple of minutes ago. Instructions on what to do are contained within each file you will have to edit.

    * You won't be using MySQL for this exercise but will instead be using the animals array in the `server.js` file.
