**Instructions**:

  * Familiarize yourself with the Mocha and Chai documentation. Choose to read either the should, expect, or assert guide, and refer to it throughout the exercise.

  * Consider a function, called `disemvowel`, which accepts a string and returns a version of the string without vowels.

  * Your task is to use Chai to add some extra tests to the test suite for `disemvowel`.

  * With your partner, determine what a "representative example" of an input to `disemvowel` might be.

  * What do we expect to receive? What should the function return of this input?

  * What different formats can this sort of input take?

  * What _don't_ we expect? What should happen in this case?

  * When you think you're done, explain to your partner why the test you've written totally describes `disemvowel`.
