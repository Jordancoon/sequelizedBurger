# Week 10 (LIRI Bot)

### Overview

In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Before You Begin

1. LIRI will display your latest tweets. If you don't already have an account on Twitter, make one and post a few tweets about your latest projects.

2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.

3. Make a .gitignore file and add the following lines to it.

```
npm-debug.log
node_modules
.DS_Store
```

4. In your git or bash terminal, create a node app using `npm`

```
cd liri-node-app
npm init
```

You will be prompted for several values. You are recommended to accept each default (press enter or return to each prompt). Once complete you will see a message like this:

```
name: (liri-node-app)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository: (https://github.com/username/liri-node-app.git)
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)

About to write to /your/project/path/package.json:
{
  "name": "liri-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "liri-node-app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {},
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/username/liri-node-app.git"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/username/liri-node-app/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/username/liri-node-app#readme"
}


Is this ok? (yes)
```


5. Next, you will create a heroku app from your git bash or terminal. Make sure you're in your git project folder `liri-node-app`

 ```
 heroku create
 ```

6. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and IMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.

   * [Twitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter)
   * [Spotify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify)
   * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
     * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com).

7. Get your Twitter API keys by following these steps:

   * Step One: Visit <https://apps.twitter.com/app/new>
   * Step Two: Fill out the form with dummy data. Type `http://google.com` in the Website input. Don't fill out the Callback URL input. Then submit the form.
   * Step Three: On the next screen, click the Keys and Access Tokens tab to get your consumer key and secret.
     * Copy and set these values as [Heroku Config Vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) using the following command within your project folder
     * `heroku config:set CONSUMER_KEY=yourconsumerkey CONSUMER_SECRET=yourconsumersecret`
   * Step Four: At the bottom of the page, click the `Create my access token` button to get your access token key and secret.
     * Copy and set these values as [Heroku Config Vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) using the following command within your project folder
     * `heroku config:set ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=youraccesstokenkey ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=youraccesstokensecret`

8. export HEROKU_CONFIG=$(heroku config --json)

### Instructions

IMPORTANT: You are keeping your twitter keys secure with Heroku. In order to run Liri locally, you will need to first get your keys from heroku with this command:

```
export HEROKU_CONFIG=$(heroku config --json)
```

1. Make a JavaScript file named `keys.js`.

Inside keys.js your file will look like this:

```JavaScript
console.log('this is loaded');

var config = JSON.parse(process.env.HEROKU_CONFIG);

exports.twitterKeys = {
  consumer_key: config.CONSUMER_KEY,
  consumer_secret: config.CONSUMER_SECRET,
  access_token_key: config.ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY,
  access_token_secret: config.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
}
```

2. Make a file called `random.txt`.

   * Inside of `random.txt` put the following in with no extra characters or white space:
     * spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"

3. Make a JavaScript file named `liri.js`.

4. At the top of the `liri.js` file, write the code you need to grab the data from keys.js. Then store the keys in a variable.

5. Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `my-tweets`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`


### What Each Command Should Do

1. `node liri.js my-tweets`

   * This will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
     * Artist(s)
     * The song's name
     * A preview link of the song from Spotify
     * The album that the song is from

   * if no song is provided then your program will default to
     * "The Sign" by Ace of Base

3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating.
       * Rotten Tomatoes URL.
     ```

   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
     * If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/>
     * It's on Netflix!

4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.
     * Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.

### BONUS

* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

* Make sure you append each command you run to the `log.txt` file. 

* Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
